# Constellation

A codebase visualizer built with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind v4. Scans the repo, extracts top-level exported symbols via `ts-morph`, and renders them as a grid of file cards grouped by directory. Long-term goal: overlay live AI-agent activity (read/write badges, reasoning callouts) on top of the static map.

The visualizer scans `process.cwd()` and dogfoods itself — the home page renders this very repo.

## Working with this project

The user is an amateur developer. Lean toward:
- Explaining the *why* behind suggestions, not just the *what*.
- Calling out when something is a foot-gun (force-push, rm -rf, destructive SQL, etc.) before doing it.
- Preferring boring, well-trodden patterns over clever ones.
- Flagging when a "quick fix" will create tech debt later.

## Git — aggressive proactive management

The user has asked me to manage git proactively and aggressively. That means:

- **Commit often, in small logical units.** After any meaningful change (a feature works, a bug is fixed, a refactor is done), commit it without being asked. Don't batch unrelated changes into one commit.
- **Write good commit messages.** Format: short imperative subject (≤72 chars), blank line, then a body explaining the *why* if non-obvious. Reference what changed and why, not how.
- **Stage explicitly.** Use `git add <file>` over `git add -A` / `git add .` to avoid accidentally committing junk (`.env`, build artifacts, secrets).
- **Keep `.gitignore` healthy.** Add entries proactively when new tooling is introduced (node_modules, .venv, dist, .DS_Store, .env*, etc.).
- **Branch for non-trivial work.** Anything bigger than a small fix gets its own branch. Merge back to `main` when done.
- **Never force-push, never `reset --hard`, never `clean -fd` without confirming first.** Even when "managing aggressively," destructive ops always need a heads-up.
- **Push only when asked.** Local commits are free; pushes are visible. Don't `git push` without explicit confirmation.
- **Surface git state.** When starting a session, glance at `git status` / `git log` so I know what's in flight.

## Conventions

- Default branch: `main`.
- Line endings: LF.
- No trailing whitespace; newline at EOF.
